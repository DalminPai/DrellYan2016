## Environment
	source setup.sh


## Example
	source setup.sh
	cd Include/Example
	python Run.py BatchJobInfo.json
	(run shell scripts generated by Run.py)

   * MakeHist_Example.cxx: make dimuon mass distribution
      * all .cxx file should take (.txt file name, sample name(tag), isMC, normalization factor) as arguments
   * BatchJobInfo.json: contain batch job information
      * code name, luminosity, queue name, list of samples & # jobs to be run
   * Run.py: make workspace for batch job & generate shell scripts for job submission & getting outputs
      * take "BatchJobInfo.json" as an argument
      * Generated shell script
         * script\_qsub\_ALL.sh: submit all jobs (qsub)
         * script\_GetOutput.sh: after finishing all jobs, get output root files & merge them into one root file

## Details
   * Include/SampleInfo_Latest.json: contain all sample information (data, MC)
      * sample name, x-section, sum(weights), directory, and so on
      * New sample should be included in this json file
   * Include/Split_BatchJobs.py: split jobs for one sample
      * take "SampleInfo_Latest.json" as an argument
      * It is used by "Run.py"
   * Include/MergeROOTFiles.py: merge root file into one root file
      * It is used by "script\__GetOutput.sh"
